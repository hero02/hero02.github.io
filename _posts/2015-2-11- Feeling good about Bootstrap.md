<p>What is boostrap? Bootstrap is a free collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. This framework is a web designer's dream. The feeling is like Home Simpson when he see donuts. Whats got us salavating this much? Well Im about to tell you.</p>

Bootstrap allows you to make it your own. So you can go into the frame work and add what you want and take out what you dont need.
