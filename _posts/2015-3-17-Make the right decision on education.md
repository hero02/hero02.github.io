##What you should consider

I've had the opportunity to attend 3 educational institutions after graduating highschool. I have no idea what I wanted to study so I didnt know what to look for as a college so didn't really think about what colleges or university to attend. But ow that I have gone threw this years of learning I can see how important it is to know what you want to learn and where to learn it.


###Community College

####Advisors
(This is from my experince) As a student in community college I found it really hard to forward my education. You are lucky if you find a advisor who cares to sign you up for the right classes and keeps you on the right track. So if your going to a a community college get some info on the advisors. 

####Class size
Community college is also larger in size so that mean its gonna be hard to find one on one with your professor. Usually in large size colleges you are just a student ID and are  not given the personal attention that some students need.

####Cost
This is the one thing that is great about community college it is a lot cheaper. Public colleges, on average, cost less than private colleges. Hereâ€™s the average tuition costs for the 2012-13 school year, according to a report by The College Board:

* public four-year in-state: $8,655

####Teachers
Are usually really experienced in their field but there are some who are forced to teach a class that they know very little about. 

####Classes
Community colleges course are usually low in count. There are very few specific degress and most don't past an AA degree.

###University(Private)

###Advisors
The advisors are real help and have more knowledge on the track that you should take because they are usually the teacher in that field.

###Class size 
Private uiversities are much smaller than community college. This means that classes are smaller ad there is a better chance that the teacher can interact with the stidents.

####Cost
Universities are usually privatley owned so they are not funded by the government. Cost are way more higher than community colleges.

* private nonprofit four-year: $29,056.

####Teachers
Teachers are real professionals in their field of study. 

####Classes
Universities have a vast collection of degress that students can choose from. Many of them go as high as Master Degree and BA dregree.

I hope that this gives you some insight on considerig where you want to recieve your education. I persoally got to an Art school and I love it. Why? Because it is subject specific in art. Teachers really give your than one on one attention and are very good at what they do. The classes are small and students are divers. Cost for schooling as of 2013-2014 is $17,704. So a bit cheaper than private school. 

So if your are a highschool senior then this is the time to consider where and what you want to studies. Considered all these aspects when making a decision.
