Codepen is a playground of sorts for web coders. Yes! That right! A playground. This wonderful playground provides with all you need all in one place just like a playground. You got your swing and next to it is the jungle gym, then next to that is the mega slide and so forth. Codepen is the same thing you have you HTML section, then your CSS section, then your JAVASCRIPT section. No need to longer go from file to file. And the live column shows you your design live so no need to open a tab and keep refreshing a page to see you results. Here are a couple more reason to use codepen if you are not convinced yet.

<b>1. CSS Options</b>

<b>2. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Options</b>
