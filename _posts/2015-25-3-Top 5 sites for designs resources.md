If you are anything like anybody in this world we all crave free stuff. Especially if your a designer this can be very helpful, even better if the item is free for commercial use. Here I have complied a list of websites that i have found useful over the years I have been a graphic and web designer. Most of these site have paid content also so if you see something you really like you can still purchase them. These site all differentiate on items such as photos, others i use just for fonts, and psd templates and what not.
