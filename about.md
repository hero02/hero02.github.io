###Who is Herodney?

* Started drawing at age 10, graphic designing at 17 and web design at 24.

###What makes me different from other web/graphic designers

I love to really get into my work. I don't like just setting people up with a template and just building on it. I want to make sure that what i make for you really speaks of you. I guess you can say that's one thing bad about me, I tend to want everything perfect for that person so I spend alot longer designing.
