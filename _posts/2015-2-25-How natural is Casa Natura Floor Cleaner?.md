It is also phosphate free which helps keep our rivers and lakes healthy.This products is excellent for people who cannot stand the smell of amonia that you would get from other houshold floor cleaner.

#Product Testing

So we wanted to see how this eco-friendly formula floor cleaner live up to its hype. I decided I was going to test this floor cleaner on my kic=tchen floor and see if it was better than my regular kitchen cleaer which is not enviroment safe. I can say from the start this product is alot better when it comes to the smell. There is no strong chemical smell, that is usally hard to deal with from my experience, that you will get from other products. After putting some of the product in diluted water I proceeded to mop and this product by far did the job. It worked well on my floors and left no residue or streaks. After mopping the floor was clean and no stickyness on the floor as you would get with most products. By far I love this product and would love to tree out their other household cleaning products.
