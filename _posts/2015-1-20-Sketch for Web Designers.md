###Filtering Information

Your sketch notes are not for everyone else. They’re for you! That’s the best part about it. 

You can draw exactly what you see or are shown, but you can also draw what makes sense to you. Whatever helps you remember and understand the topic more clearly. Sketching with a sharpie is also a bit of fun if the topic you’re trying to capture is dry.

You’ll often meet clients in industries you’ve never come across before, so sketch noting the information that they give you can help visually connect the dots and make sense of things.

Sketch noting can help you capture and filter the information in a unique way that you will understand. 

###Building Blocks

Now for some of the building blocks of sketch noting. Let’s look at some of the building blocks.

**The Language**

Typography is effectively whatever notes that you jot down. You’re doing this already! Good start.

**The Pictures**

Objects and people are best represented in pictures. You can give your illustrations a lot more personality, making it more likely you’ll remember what you’re putting down on paper. You don’t need to be a good illustrator, stick figures will do! Just keep at it. You’ll see your skills improve over time. 

**The Structure**

Now, link it up together using frames, connectors, bullets and dividers. This will give everything some structure. If you’ve ever seen a mind map before you’ll get the gist of it. If you have time you can even do a bit of practice.
