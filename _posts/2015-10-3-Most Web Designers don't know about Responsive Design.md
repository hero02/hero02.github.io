##Why you should learn responsive web design##

We all know that technology has been rapidly growing over these small few years and there is nothing we can do about but adapt. Before everyone had a desktop computer at the house running on dail up internet. Over they years our internet play forms have travled from desktop to phone to tablet to smaart tv. As a web designer back then we did not need to worry about responsive design, that because we only had the desktop to design for. But now with these new devices a web designer must begin implementing responsive design to websites. By doing this we give the user the ability to  view the website on different platforms and not struggle to view the original desktop view on a smaller device.

Many website design companies are already making responsive web design a standard in their web design. So does it not make sense that as a novice of the web design business that this is a skill set that you should familiarize yourself with. This will definitley give you a step up on the competiton.

###Advantages of Responsive Web Design###

* ####Flexible####

Responsive web design sites are fluid, meaning the content moves freely across all screen resolutions and all devices. Both the grids and the images are fluid. Just as a liquid spreads out or draws in to allow its content to fill an allotted space and retain its appearance, responsive web designâ€™s fluidity achieves the same result with website content on a device screen.

 #### Great for SEO

Managing one site and one SEO campaign is far easier than managing two sites and two SEO campaigns. This is a key advantage a responsive website has over a separate mobile site. That being said, there are benefits to having a mobile-specific SEO strategy, such as optimizing for keywords that are more likely to be searched when someone is on their smartphone. Responsive web design enhances SEO efforts by having all your visitors directed to a single site no matter what they prefer to use as a device.

* ####Excellent User Experience####

responsive web design is about providing the optimal user experience irrespective of whether they use a desktop computer, a smartphone, a tablet or a smart-TV. Responsive web design accommodates the busy professional during the day and the wide-awake college student needing access to your site anytime. No scrolling or resizing is needed for any visitor to access your website from their favorite device.
