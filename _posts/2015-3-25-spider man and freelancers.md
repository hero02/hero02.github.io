title: Spiderman finally joins the Avengers, breaking from freelance and joining a team
---

Big news recently came across the Marvel Universe. Spiderman is going to join the avengers. After spidey rights have been held by sony studios for so long they finally decided to share the rights with marvel after two failed reboot throught out the years. This means big things for fans all over who know that spidey is a major character in the marvel civil war storyline which is coming out in 2016. So how can you compare this legendary character to you? Spiderman has been a freelance hero for years before his talents were recognized by S.H.I.E.L.D and the Avengers. During his time their he had to learn to work with this big team thats been in the hero buisness for years now.  Just like you,  if you are a student or a freelancer, when you decide to work for a firm or a business you must learn to work with your fellow co-workers.  

The transition from freelance and actual job sometimes can be nerve wrecking especially if you are a student. Many students are prep for the big world of work but don't really know they dynamic of the work enviroment. Don't worry you have been training for this your whole life.

###Teamwork
You have been learning this throughout your whole life. In sports you have to learn with a team. If you had siblings you had to learn to work togther to stay out of trouble with your parents. Even in school you had mutiple group projects in which you had to work with different poeple. The only difference is that now you are prepared to deal with the emotions and drama that usually goes through a team. 

###Communication
This is another skill that has been in your arsenal your whole life. In any effective team you must learn to communicate. If spidey doesn't warn ironman about the villian behind him he could be gravely hurt. So being able to talk to your co-workers can make  a huge difference in the work enviroment. This creates cohesion and friendships in the long run.

###Smarts
Remember with great knowledge come great responsibility. Ok that's not how it goes but you know what I mean. By constantly learning on the job and asking questions the better you will be. The more knowledge you have the more work you'll get, don't worry all this means is that they trust you and know you can do the job.

So just like Spiderman and the Avengers, learn to work with your teammate so you can do great things in the work enviroment.
