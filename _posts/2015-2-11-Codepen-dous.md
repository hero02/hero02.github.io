Codepen is a playground of sorts for web coders. Yes! That right! A playground. This wonderful playground provides with all you need all in one place just like a playground. You got your swing and next to it is the jungle gym, then next to that is the mega slide and so forth. Codepen is the same thing you have you HTML section, then your CSS section, then your JAVASCRIPT section. No need to longer go from file to file. And the live column shows you your design live so no need to open a tab and keep refreshing a page to see you results. Here are a couple more reason to use codepen if you are not convinced yet.

<b>1. CSS Options</b>

CSS options allow you quickly add a reset.css, you can write sass or less if your organized that way, and allows you to upload a css from another source from anywhere. Codepen also has CSSLint which checks your code for any errors.
