title: 3 distractions a college student can experience
---

Today we take a look at three distractions that most college students experince. Many new college students are now on their own and now have to deal with these distractions head on. This is what college deal with everyday and have to find a way to deal with it and grow.

3.Medical
One of the most harmful distractions that students experience is the phenomenon of binge drinking, or consuming four or more drinks within a two-hour period, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Cheap alcohol and easy availability are the hallmarks of a binge drinking culture, which can negatively affect every aspect of a student's life. As the center's summary indicates, students who become intoxicated before age 19 are more likely to become frequent heavy drinkers.

2.Sexual
College marks the transition to new relationships that range from casual dating to friendships based on common interests, and the student's first real experience with sexual intimacy, according to the "Morrisville State College Chimes." At the same time, however, these initial experiences seem confusing and overwhelming, since previous rules of courtship no longer seem to apply. Students interviewed for the newspaper agreed that this emotional landscape can be distracting and difficult to navigate, particularly for those who place a premium on emotional commitment.

1.Technological
The presence of laptop computers, smartphones and text messaging devices on campuses nationwide often leaves professors feeling that they're competing for students' time and attention. Wireless Internet technology exposes students to many online distractions, whether it's playing games, surfing websites or viewing videos.
