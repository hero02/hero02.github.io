Most web and graphic designers who are using Photoshop have probably shifted through 
various design blogs on how to use masking in Photoshop. But many of this blogs are

Sometimes you just want a simple breakdown that you can understand. So for my fellow 
novice I will collect the best tutorial articles and videos for easy tools to use for masking in 
Photoshop.
